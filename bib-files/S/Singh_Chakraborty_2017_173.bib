 abstractnote  = {This paper represents the bi-level linear programming problem in an imprecise and uncertain mixed environment. The aim of this paper is to introduce coefficients of leader and the follower’s objective function and the constraints as the fuzzy random variable. To determine the optimal value of the leader and follower’s objectives a new methodology is developed for bi-level linear programming model in the presence of fuzzy random variable. A numerical example is solved to demonstrate the methodology.},
